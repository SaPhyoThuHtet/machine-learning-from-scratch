Normalization:
The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values. 
For machine learning, every dataset does not require normalization.(Ref: https://medium.com/@urvashilluniya/why-data-normalization-is-necessary-for-machine-learning-models-681b65a05029)
